# flutterduck

This is my first attempt at a real git repo, so go easy on me, I'm screwing things up as I go.

I started by installing Hugo on my Ubuntu VM. I then downloaded the Aether theme. 

From there, I built the Flutterduck site. The goal is to have it automatically build on Netlify.

Fingers crossed...
