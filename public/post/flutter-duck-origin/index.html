        <p>FlutterDuck. What a strange name. What does it have to do with football, technology, pinball, writing, movies, or anything else that
the author enjoys?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to explain that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the Buffalo Bills and have been for most of my life. When I watch the games in my theater, I&rsquo;m frequently in
a chat room with other fans. One time, during Josh Allen&rsquo;s rookie season, Allen threw a terrible pass. Usually when a
quarterback does that, it&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;duck.&rdquo; But this time, someone in the room said he threw a &ldquo;flutter duck,&rdquo; and that phrase
just stuck - so all of Josh Allen&rsquo;s bad passes are now called flutter ducks. I liked the name, so registered the domain. Now, two
years later, I&rsquo;ve decided to do something with it.</p>
<p>Why here? Well, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn how to use git for awhile. I created a GitHub account a few years ago, but never did
much with it aside from throw some rudimentary Python Raspberry Pi scripts up, so I felt like this was a good first project to get
a better handle on git commands and GitHub&rsquo;s process. After waking up the morning of July 25th, and seeing a tweet by @varcharr
explaining how she setup her site, I was motivated to &ldquo;get it done.&rdquo; It took a few hours, and some tinkering of settings to get
it to properly work, but it all seems good now!</p>
<p>What will I be doing on the site? Talking about anything I feel like talking about I guess&hellip;  From football, to technology, to
InfoSec, to pinball, to photography, to writing, and anything else in between.  Enjoy!</p>
