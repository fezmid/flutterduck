I've wanted a logo for FlutterDuck since I first kicked it off, but really had no idea what to do with it. I asked my sister, who does
amazing graphics design, but she was too busy to assist. When I stumbled across a site called Fiverr, and found someone willing to make
a logo for as little as $5, I decided to jump on it. The logo didn't have to be perfect, but would at least be better than what I had, 
which was nothing.

I worked with someone on the site named [noumanali321](https://www.fiverr.com/noumanali321), and this person did a great job for me with
very little direction. When I first signed up for the gig, I basically said, "Check out FlutterDuck.com and make something that represents 
the site." Since I paid very little, I was just looking for some fresh ideas because I had none. Most of the designs that were presented were 
cool, but didn't really resonate with me. However one of them stood out and was a conglomerate of all of the topics I like to discuss here. 
After some tweaks, including changing the duck's eye to a power button to represent technology, it was done!

While the above is the "3d Mockup" (which I now wish I had in real life...), the actual logos are below - with the fonts below and to
the side of the fluttering duck. 

{{< image src="FlutterDuck-below.jpg" alt="A duck with a football for a wing, a pinball flipper for a tail, and a power button for an eye - the FlutterDuck logo.">}}

In addition to the cool design, I really fell in love with the font. It's called "Caviar Dreams" (why do fonts have such weird 
names?), and I think that the distinctive lower-case sideways "e" gives the name some character.

I still have to figure out how to make a favicon for the site. As part of the deliverables, I was given Photoshop files, EPS files, JPG, ang PNG, so
I should be able to figure out how to turn my duck into a favicon, I just have to read about it. If you see the favicon already, you'll know that I
succeeded! I also want to look into using Caviar Dreams as the font for this site. Finally, I want to see if I can change the Hugo Aether theme to use
the logo on the new FlutterDuck main page and at the top of each article, instead of just using text. But that's a challenge for another day.

Is it the perfect logo? No, far from it. Does it fit where I am right now? 100%! And I love it.
