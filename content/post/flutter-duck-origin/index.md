FlutterDuck. What a strange name. What does it have to do with football, technology, pinball, writing, movies, or anything else that
the author enjoys? 

I'm here to explain that.

I'm a big fan of the Buffalo Bills and have been for most of my life. When I watch the games in my theater, I'm frequently in
a chat room with other fans. One time, during Josh Allen's rookie season, Allen threw a terrible pass. Usually when a
quarterback does that, it's called a "duck." But this time, someone in the room said he threw a "flutter duck," and that phrase
just stuck - so all of Josh Allen's bad passes are now called flutter ducks. I liked the name, so registered the domain. Now, two
years later, I've decided to do something with it.

Why here? Well, I've been wanting to learn how to use git for awhile. I created a GitHub account a few years ago, but never did
much with it aside from throw some rudimentary Python Raspberry Pi scripts up, so I felt like this was a good first project to get
a better handle on git commands and GitHub's process. After waking up the morning of July 25th, and seeing a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/varcharr">@varcharr</a>
explaining how she setup her site, I was motivated to "get it done." It took a few hours, and some tinkering of settings to get
it to properly work, but it all seems good now!

What will I be doing on the site? Talking about anything I feel like talking about I guess...  From football, to technology, to
InfoSec, to pinball, to photography, to writing, and anything else in between.  Enjoy!
