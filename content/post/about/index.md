Who am I? I'm just a guy... sitting in front of a computer... asking it to love me.

Oh wait, no, I mixed up my computer stuff with my movie stuff. Let's try that again.

Seriously though, I'm just a regular guy who wanted to learn a little more about GitHub and Hugo, so decided to make a site to help
with that learning process. 

My name's Chris White, and I'm known as Fezmid on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/fezmid). 

I have many interests, and I may or may not talk about them as time goes on here. Some of them are:

* American Football (Buffalo Bills!)
* [Board Games](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/Fezmid2)
* Learning
* [Movies](http://www.invelos.com/dvdcollection.aspx/fezmid)
* Technology (particularly InfoSec)
* Photography
* [Pinball](https://flutterduck.com/post/pinball-wizard-1/)
* [Teaching](https://www.bu.edu/csmet/profile/chris-white/)
* Video Games
* Writing, both fiction (for fun)  and [technology](https://www.neowin.net/profile/christopher_white/)

Technology is my main passion. I grew up in the 80s and my family always had a computer around. We had a Commodore 64, a Commodore 128,
a Commodore Amiga 500 (see a trend?). We also had a Timex Sinclair 1000 and a Timex Sinclair 2068. We had an Intellivision, and had the
optional computer-add on for it. I've always had computer around me, and I've always loved playing with them and learning new things. 
That's what led me to a career as a UNIX administrator, a database administrator, a storage administrator, then into a management role,
and finally into an information security role I'm in now. 

Along the way, I've done other things. I currently write (when I have time) for [Neowin.net](https://www.neowin.net/profile/christopher_white/), a technology site.
I also am a facilitator for the Masters program at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/csmet/profile/chris-white/), which I find very
personally rewarding. I love competeting, either against myself or others, which probably explains my love of board games and video games.
I love movies and photography, and focus on the technical aspects. I did a photoshoot for a class many years ago, and this is one of my
[favorite creative pictures I've taken](https://www.flickr.com/photos/43777639@N06/4471413888/in/album-72157623722581118/).

As I mentioned, I love movies, and one of my favorite movie quotes of all time is:
> Never give up, never surrender! - Galaxy Quest

And most of all, I love learning. Which is why this site exists. This page was created to test some of the Hugo
Markdown language. I found a good reference page on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/hugo-generator/wiki/markdown_syntax/)
that was helpful to start my journey.
